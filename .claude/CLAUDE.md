# Project Context

Read `.claude/context/` for project-specific information:
- `project-overview.md` - What this project is and its purpose
- `conventions.md` - Code style and patterns
- `tech-stack.md` - Build tools and commands

## Agent Workflow

This project uses a multi-agent development workflow. Invoke `/project-manager` to start a feature development cycle with automated architecture review, implementation, code review, and release.

## Global Rules

Comments should explain *why*, not *what*. Avoid superfluous comments that merely restate what the code does.
